## README

 NOTE: We should work using both pial(grey-matter csf boundary) surface as 
       well as the grey-matter white-matter boundary. As the combination 
       of these surfaces has been used in published studies of cortical 
       thickness we would be justified in using the volume bounded by 
       these two surfaces in our calculation of the M/EEG forward solutions.
 
 NOTE: The current surfaces "Polish" 213 through 217 have bumps, which
       may be related to the triangle orientation issue which I assume is 
       caused by a bug in the SplitEdges() function. 
       -- FIXED A TRIANGLE ORIENTATION BUG IN  RemoveSmallDegree3(), WHICH 
          MAY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM...
       

 NOTE: Possible issue with current RegionMapping, presumably due to 
       incorrect "Mask" <-> "Surface" allignment, with certain 
       regions being irregular or noncontiguous. See, for example, 
       lPFCVL
       

 NOTE: Should consider rescaling cortical surfaces to maintain constant
       total surface area across resolutions. Currently total surface
       area decreases with decreasing resolution.

 #As the mapping process is dodgy/inaccurate/artificial at best using 
 #the .nii Mask on the fly would be problematic. Better to use this:
  
   Mask_<ConnectivityMatrixName>.nii #Contains: volume data for ROI mask
 
 #once in order to create a RegionMapping_*.mat file:

   RegionMapping_<SurfaceName>_<ConnectivityMatrixName>.mat

 #which ideally has been hand checked by someone who knows the parcellation 
 #and correct the mapping produced by the sort of automated mapping procedure 
 #found in ScriptSurfaceToROI.m
