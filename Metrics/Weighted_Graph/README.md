# Weighted Graph

This directory provides a set of basic functions for calculating weighted graph
metrics. Most of the functions represent a small, and old, subset of Olaf's 
[Brain Connectivity Toolbox](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/), with some 
minor modifications for the current purposes. 

If you want to do any significant graph analysis, I suggest you obtain and use
[BCT](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/). These functions are here, 
primarily, to support the PlotGraphMetrics() plotting tool, which is intended 
to provide a quick over of a Connectivity's graph properties.


### Usage:
**Don't** -- if you want acces to low level graph metrics, use 
[BCT](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/).
